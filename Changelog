Changelog:
1.01.01.01, 30/10/2017
Created the project repository and added the changelog.

1.01.01.02, 30/10/2017
Added all important data files and skeleton code to master.

1.01.02.01, 30/10/2017
Added namespace std to all code and added path to project.cpp.

1.01.03.01, 31/10/2017
Added foundations for the code that supports the reading of the datafiles, and makes the data more accessible.

1.01.03.02, 01/11/2017
Improved the code that supports reading of datafiles.

1.01.03.03, 01/11/2017
Changed the code so that the temperature measurements are now averaged and added together so that the entry for each date gives one
average temperature rather than each temperature measurement for every day, giving many measurements for each day.

1.01.04.01, 02/11/2017
Added the foundations for code that checks the average temperature of each day in a year.

1.01.04.02, 02/11/2017
Added a way of plotting the mean temperatures of every day in a single year, error bars remain, however.

1.01.05.01, 02/11/2017
Added a way to measure the temperature of one day through every year measured.

1.01.05.02, 02/11/2017
Added plot for tempOnDay and made the canvas appear immediately.

1.01.06.01, 06/11/2017
Added code for a GY-comparison function and the standard deviation of temperature during a month.

1.01.06.02, 06/11/2017
Fixed a few bugs with temptrender.h.

1.01.06.03, 06/11/2017
Improved the readfile function so that it gives the standard deviation of the temperature for each day in "usefulfile" and
removed the now unnecessary SDmonth function.

1.01.07.01, 06/11/2017
Added a function which compares the mean temperature of a given year between the two datasets used (visby and lund).

1.01.07.02, 06/11/2017
Commented some code in the header file.

1.01.08.01, 07/11/2017
Added some error messages and a histogram for one day over the years.

1.01.08.02, 07/11/2017
Improved the code for plotting and removed unnecessary code.

1.01.08.03, 07/11/2017
Improved the code for the temperature of a single day, and updated the histogram the function prints.

1.01.08.04, 07/11/2017
Added standard deviation functionality for the comparison function.

1.01.08.05, 08/11/2017
Commented most of the code and removed GY-comparison, as it did nothing.

1.01.08.06, 08/11/2017
Updated the compare function so that it is up to standard with the yearmean function.

1.01.08.07, 08/11/2017
Fixed a bug with yearmean that made it impossible to stop giving city names.

1.02.01.01, 08/11/2017
Commented and finalized the code, specifically in the temponday function.

1.02.01.02, 10/11/2017
Fixed a slight bug with one of the temperature functions that caused it to not quit after running once.
