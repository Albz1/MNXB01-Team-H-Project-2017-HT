Improved the code that supports reading of datafiles.

1.01.03.03, 01/11/2017
Changed the code so that the temperature measurements are now averaged and added together so that the entry for each date gives one
average temperature rather than each temperature measurement for every day, giving many measurements for each day.

1.01.04.01, 02/11/2017
Added the foundations for code that checks the average temperature of each day in a year.

1.01.04.02, 02/11/2017
Added a way of plotting the mean temperatures of every day in a single year, error bars remain, however.

1.01.05.01, 02/11/2017
Added a way to measure the temperature of one day through every year measured.

1.01.06.01, 02/11/2017
Added code for histogram and standard deviation calculations.
